 ### Band-pedia is an application where users are able to browse through a list of bands, and view their specific artist page in which details a set list with songs the user is able to play through a browser and view the lyrics for.
 
 ### Project Info:
 #### - Main opening page features a list of bands for users to browse through. You are able to select the "View Band Information" button to populate the text box with quick information about the band.
 #### - After selecting a band and pressing the "View Artist Page" button, you see the Artist page, specific to the band you have chosen. Here, songs by the artist are featured in a list, selecting an element in the list will populate the text box with song lyrics. Pressing the "Play" button will open the link to the song in a browser and increment the number of times the user has played the song.
 #### - There are 7 bands total (set default), with 3 songs for the first band (Arctic Monkeys), and 1-2 songs for the remaining bands.
